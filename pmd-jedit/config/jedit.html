<h1>PMD-JEdit Plug-in Users' Guide</h1>
<hr>
<p>PMD is a Java source code analyzer - it finds unused variables, questionable design decisions, empty catch blocks, and so forth.
You can read much more about PMD here - http://pmd.sf.net/.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Uninstall any old PMD-JEdit plugins
<li>Unzip the PMD-JEdit-bin-0.6.zip file into your JEdit directory; it'll put a couple of jar files into your jars directory.
<li>Restart JEdit and you'll be ready to go.
</ul>
<h3>Integration</h3>
<p>There's a new 'PMD' menu item in the Plugins menu.  This checks your currently displayed Java code and puts the results in the ErrorList.</p>
<p>There's also a new section in the Global Options configuration panel that lets you pick rule sets.</p>
<h3>License</h3>
<p>The PMD-JEdit plugin is free software released under the Apache license.</p>
