<h1>PMD-JEdit Plug-in Users' Guide</h1>
<hr>
<p>PMD is a Java source code analyzer - it finds unused variables, questionable design decisions, empty catch blocks, and so forth.
You can read much more about PMD here - http://pmd.sf.net/.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Uninstall any old PMD-JEdit plugins
<li>Unzip the PMD-JEdit-bin-1.2.zip file into your JEdit directory; it'll put a couple of jar files into your jars directory.
<li>Restart JEdit and you'll be ready to go.
</ul>
<h3>Integration</h3>
<p>There's a new 'PMD' menu item in the Plugins menu.  This has several submenu options</p>
<ul>
<li>"Check current file" checks your currently displayed Java code</li>
<li>"Check all files in current directory" does just that</li>
<li>"Check directory recursively" does just that, too! </li>
</ul>
<p>"Current directory" means "the directory which is displayed in the file system browser".  So, for
example, if you wanted to run PMD on your whole source tree, and your top level 
source directory is named "src", you would 1) double-click on the "src" directory and 
then 2) select the "PMD->Check directory recursively" menu option.</p>
<p>All those options put any errors into the ErrorList so you can then go jumping around your project fixing stuff.
<p>There's a section in the Utilities->Global Options->Plugins configuration panel that lets you pick which rule sets you want to use.</p>
<h3>License</h3>
<p>The PMD-JEdit plugin is free software released under the Apache license.</p>
