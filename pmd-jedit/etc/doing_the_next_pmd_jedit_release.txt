update the release date in the changelog

ant release <-- new task, should create jar and zip it up into a pmd-jedit.zip that looks like:
jars/pmd-0.3.jar
jars/PMDJEditPlugin.jar

so that it can be unzipped like an overlay

cvs add -kb pmd-jedit-0.1.jar
cvs rm pmd-jedit-0.1.jar
cvs ci -m "adding new jar, removing old one"
cd c:\data\pmd-jedit
cvs rtag -D tomorrow "pmd_jedit_release_0_4" pmd-jedit
rmdir /q /s c:\tmp\pmd-jedit
mkdir c:\tmp\pmd-jedit
cvs export -d c:\tmp\pmd-jedit -r pmd_jedit_release_0_1 pmd-jedit
zip it up, rename it to pmd-jedit-0.1.zip
unzip it into c:\jedit

1) run jedit ok?
2) open the options panel?
