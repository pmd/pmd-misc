move the zip file into c:\tmp

Create the src release:
cd lib
cvs add -kb PMDJEditPlugin-0.2.jar
cvs rm PMDJEditPlugin-0.1.jar
cvs ci -m "adding new jar, removing old one"
cd c:\data\pmd
cvs rtag -D tomorrow "pmd_jedit_release_0_2" pmd-jedit
rmdir /q /s c:\tmp\pmd-jedit
mkdir c:\tmp\pmd-jedit

TESTS:
