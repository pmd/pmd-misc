<h1>PMD-JEdit Plug-in Users' Guide</h1>
<hr>
<p>PMD is a Java source code analyzer - it finds unused variables, questionable design decisions, empty catch blocks, and so forth.
You can read much more about PMD here - http://pmd.sf.net/.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Uninstall any old PMD-JEdit plugins
<li>Unzip the PMD-JEdit-bin-2.4.zip file into your JEdit directory; it'll put a couple of jar files into your jars directory.
<li>Restart JEdit and you'll be ready to go.
</ul>
<h3>Integration</h3>
<p>There's a new 'PMD' menu item in the Plugins menu.  This has several submenu options</p>
<ul>
<li>"Check current file" checks your currently displayed Java code</li>
<li>"Check all files in current directory" does just that</li>
<li>"Check directory recursively" does just that, too! </li>
<li>Detect Duplicate Code
<ul>
<li>"In current file" checks your currently displayed Java code for duplicates</li>
<li>"Check all files in current directory" same thing for the directory</li>
<li>"Check directory recursively" same thing for the directory, recursively</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>"Current directory" means "the directory which is displayed in the file system browser".  So, for
example, if you wanted to run PMD on your whole source tree, and your top level
source directory is named "src", you would 1) double-click on the "src" directory and
then 2) select the "PMD->Check directory recursively" menu option.</p>
<p>All those options put any errors into the ErrorList so you can then go jumping around your project fixing stuff.
<p>There's a section in the Utilities->Global Options->Plugins configuration panel that lets you pick which rule sets you want to use.</p>
<p>Note that the configuration panel also contains the minimum tile size for CPD to turn up a duplicate chunk.

<p>Starting 2.1, you can now add Custom Defined Rulesets with PMD plugin. Previously, if you want to use your own rulesets with the PMD plugin, you had to unjar the pmd.jar file & add your ruleset defination in the jar file & re-jar it & use it. But this procedure had to be repeated whenever a new PMD is out. But not anymore. Now you can simply point PMD plugin to your custom rulesets.xml file & drop your custom ruleset jars in either of jEdit jars directory(either system or user). Once this is done, you will be able to manipulate your Custom Rulesets just the way like the built-in ones.</p>

<p>PMD jEdit 2.2 adds updates PMD plugin to the latest and the greatest PMD release, updates to Dynamic class loading feature of jEdit and adds PMD to jEdit's File System Browser for easy access.</p>
