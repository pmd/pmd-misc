Version 0.95
- Updated pmd to version 1.8 (wow, somebody's been out of action for a while! :)
- Adapted to NB 3.6 API, did not test in earlier versions (I don't *know* that
  I broke compatibility with NB 3.5, but I may well have. File a bug on it if
  you care about NB 3.5 compatibility)
- Fixed obnoxious real-time scanning bugs (bugs 789809 and 780004)
- Removed obnoxious huge dialog that popped up when installing the module
- Made real-time scanning less wasteful (runs only when document has changed)
- Made real-time scanning re-run when PMD settings change (you can now watch
  the annotations in the document change as you change the rules in the
  options dialog)
- Fixed some smaller bugs and lurkers
- Got rid of some logging noise
- The build now includes full debugging info (previously local-variable info
  was not included), for easier debugging. I may remove this later since it
  increases classloading time (though no doubt the difference is minuscule)
