  #1429406 - NoSuchMethodError while saving options
- reworked autoscan mode that rescan only active editor now
- few UI tweaks

Version 1.5
- Updated pmd to version 3.5
- Options customization updated to plug into new NetBeans 5.0 options dialog

Version 1.4
- Updated pmd to version 3.4

Version 1.3
- Updated pmd to version 3.3
- Works with IDE 5.0
- Modified action shortcut
- Progress now uses default NetBeans API
- Added few rules specific to NetBeans that can be selected

Version 1.2
- Updated pmd to version 3.2
- JDK 1.5 sources are recognized 
- Action icon is removed from menu 

Version 1.1
- Updated pmd to version 3.1
- The sources were updated to use new plugin development support planned 
  present in recent development builds of NetBeans

Version 1.0
- Updated pmd to version 2.1
- Adapted to NB 4.0 APIs, did not test in earlier versions

Version 0.95
- Updated pmd to version 1.8 (somebody's been out of action for a while! :)
- Adapted to NB 3.6 API, did not test in earlier versions (I don't *know* that
  I broke compatibility with NB 3.5, but I may well have. File a bug on it if
  you care about NB 3.5 compatibility)
- Fixed obnoxious real-time scanning bugs (bugs 789809 and 780004)
- Removed obnoxious huge dialog that popped up when installing the module
- Made real-time scanning less wasteful (the scan used to be repeated at the
  defined interval even if you stayed in the same window and made no changes;
  that is no longer the case)
- Made real-time scanning re-run when PMD settings change (you can now watch
  the annotations in the document change as you change the rules in the
  options dialog)
- Fixed some smaller bugs and lurkers
- Changed default interval for real-time scanning to 5 seconds (from 10) ...
  note that this is the minimum interval from the *end* of one scan to the
  beginning of the next, so things don't go nuts if scans take a long time.
  The minimum interval does not apply when going to another document; in that
  case a new scan is started right away.
- Got rid of some logging noise
- The build now includes full debugging info (previously local-variable info
  was not included), for easier debugging. I may remove this later since it
  increases classloading time (though no doubt the difference is minuscule)
