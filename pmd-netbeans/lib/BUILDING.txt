---++ BUILDING 

The NetBeans IDE version 6.0M4 is currently used for the development of plugin.
Older version of harness (NB5.5) can fail to run tests.

Read the documentation of this support to get details about the 
configuration. For a quick setup it should be enough to copy
the 'pmdsuite.properties.template' file into pmdsuite.properties' edit its 
content according to comments.

Released plugin versions are built with JDK 1.5 and against NetBeans5.5.
