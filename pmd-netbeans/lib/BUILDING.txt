---++ BUILDING 

The NetBeans IDE version 5.0 or newer can be used to develop the PMD plugin
using the new plugin development support.

Read the documentation of this support to get details about the 
configuration. For a quick setup it should be enough to copy
the 'pmdsuite.properties.template' file into pmdsuite.properties' edit its 
content according to comments.

Released plugin versions are built with JDK 1.4.2 and against NetBeans5.0.
