===================================================================
To Install:
===================================================================
If you are using the binary, just unzip the Zip file
in $ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins.

If you are building from scratch, then things get a bit more
complicated.  (If you know Eclipse better than I, let me know.
I think it should be easier. . .)

Jar up the files that get dumped into the bin directory after
the build, and copy the following directory structure to the 
$ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins directory:

$ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins/net.sourceforge.pmd_0.5.0 (or current version)
  plugin.xml
  pmd-eclipse.jar                               
  lib/pmd-1.03.jar (or most recent version of PMD.)
  icons/pmd-icon-32.gif
  icons/pmd-icon-16.gif

===================================================================
To Use:
===================================================================
  
From the Windows, Preferences menu, you can select what rulesets PMD will use.
PMD can now be used in two different modes.
On the Properties page for a project, you can enable PMD for the project.  This 
will cause PMD to be run after each compile, and the PMD violations will appear as 
Warnings in the Tasks view.
You can also right click on a package or class and use the Check Code with PMD 
option.  This will run PMD on the selected files, and violations will
appear as a Task in the Tasks view.  You can mark these Tasks as complete
and remove them from the Tasks view.

Share and Enjoy!
