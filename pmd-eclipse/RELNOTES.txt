Release notes for the PMD Eclipse Plugin


v0.5.0 - 19/03/2003

NEW : Using PMD as a project incremental builder
------------------------------------------------
When PMD is used as an incremental builder, then violations are added as problem marker. Then,
markers will be removed when violations are fixed.
To enable PMD as a incremental, simply check "enable PMD" on your project PMD property
page.

UPDATED : 
---------
When PMD is used "one shot" from the popup menu, then violations are added as task. Then, markers
should be removed manually via the popup menus, either from the project (all violations for this
project will be removed), or from a file or group of files (all violations for these files will be
removed) or from the task view (all violations for all projects will be removed).

PMD markers (violations) can be filtered in the task view : either PMD task marker or PMD problem
marker or both.

PMD rule violations have a priority from 1 to 5. Markers have only 3 level of severity, so the mapping is as follow :
PMD priority 1 -> severity error, priority high
PMD priority 2 -> severity error, priority normal
PMD priority 3 -> severity warning, priority high
PMD priority 4 -> severity warning, priority normal
PMD priority 5 -> severity information, priority normal

MISC :
------
PMD engine is not shipped with the source archive. Download it from source forge and install it in
a lib subdirectory.
