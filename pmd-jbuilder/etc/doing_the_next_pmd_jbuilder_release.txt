cvs rtag -d pmd_jbuilder_release_1_3 pmd-jbuilder
and then retag everything

====================================================================
Fixed in CVS, and you can download an updated PMDOpenTool.jar file here:

http://infoether.com/~tom/PMDOpenTool.jar

that fixes this bug.  To use the file, stop JBuilder, place PMDOpenTool.jar in your jbuilder/lib/ext directory, and restart JBuilder.

Thanks for the report!

Yours,

Tom
