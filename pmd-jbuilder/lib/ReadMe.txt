To enable this plugin simply extract the following files into your JBuilder lib/ext directory:

PMDOpenTool.jar
pmd-3.4.jar
jaxen-1.1-beta-7.jar

Once you restart JBuilder the toolbars and menus should reflect that PMD is now available.

PLEASE NOTE: If you have been using previous verisons of this opentool, and the version of the pmd.jar file has changed, you need to remove the old pmd.jar file (pmd-3.2.jar for example)
