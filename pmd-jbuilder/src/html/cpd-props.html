CPD stands for "Copy and Paste Tool".  The function of CPD is to find duplicate code across all the files in a particular<BR>
project.  You can specify the minimum number of tokens that constitute a legitimate CPD find.  A token represents the smallest<BR>
parseable unit in the Java language.  For example, all Java keywords, variable names, method names, etc are considered tokens.
