Imported rule sets are those rulesets that are locatable within the current classpath but<BR>
are not part of standard PMD rule sets.  To use this, you have to supply the rule set file name <BR>
(as opposed to the rule set name).  All rule set files must be located in a hierarchy rulesets/[file name].<BR>
Rule set files are xml files.  This property page allows you to simply type in the file name without the path <BR>
without the XML extension.  It will then search the classpath for a file name of the form "rulesets/[filename].xml.<BR>
If found, it will import the rule set and make it available in the active rule set panel and the configure rule set<BR>
panel.
